Did all my links first then made contianer so it can match my figma prototype. i also aligned eveyrthing correctly and made changes with css accordingly.

Overall it looks good however I think they are grading based on how close we can copy the figma. I would change the greenish blue color back to the original blue used and the figma. I also noticed in the second  and third page you used some different pictures than your Figma, I would also switch them back to the original. The navbar elements are a little smaller. You can also get rid of the text underneath the picture on the second page. Overall it looks good, but you should try to adjust some of those to make it as close to your figma as you can.
